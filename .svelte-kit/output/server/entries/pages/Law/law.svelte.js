<h3>Kafkaesque Ruling by the Indiana Supreme Court.</h3> 
<p>David Schalk will remain suspended from the practice of law in Indiana until such time as he &quot;realizes the wrongfulness of his action_destroyer.&quot; Eight years have passed since the Indiana Supreme Court imposed the suspension without reference to David Schalk&#39;s legal argument regarding the legality of his involvement in what is loosely called a &quot;controlled by&quot; </p>
<p>The Indiana Supreme Court did not, and I&#39;m sure they could not find instances of specific conduct or statement that might tend to justify assertions &quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot; and &quot;5 of the &quot;Facts in aggrivation&quot; paragraph of their order. Concerning item &quot;2&quot;, I don&#39;t recall doing anything wrongful in the matter. The full order is linked below. Here&#39;s the &quot;Facts in aggravation&quot; section:  </p>
<p>Facts in aggravation include: (1) Respondent solicited others to commit a criminal act, which put them at risk
of arrest or physical danger; (2) Respondent has no appreciation for the wrongfulness of his conduct; (3)
Respondent made false statements or statements with reckless disregard for their truth regarding the integrity of
the judges of the trial court and Court of Appeals; (4) Respondent&#39;s assertions that his criminal prosecution was
based upon vindictiveness by law enforcement authorities is frivolous; and (5) Respondent improperly interfered with the discovery process in the disciplinary proceeding.</p>
