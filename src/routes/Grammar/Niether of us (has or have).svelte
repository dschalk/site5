<p>Neither is grammatically singular and usually takes singular verbs like is and has. When used as a pronoun to mean “not the one or the other,” it negates each of two things individually.</p>

<ul>EXAMPLES
<li>Neither of them is/are a rocket scientist.</li>
<li>Neither of us is/are happy about this.</li>
<li>Neither of the two rooms you wanted is/are available.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, neither can be used to negate not just each of two possibilities individually, but both together. Thus, in informal communication, neither is sometimes treated as plural, particularly when it is followed by the preposition of, as in constructions like neither of us, neither of them, and neither of the students.</p>

<ul>EXAMPLES
<li>Informal: Neither of us is/are correct.</li>
<li>Formal: Neither of us is correct.</li>
<li>Informal: Neither of them is/are wrong.</li>
<li>Formal: Neither of them is wrong.</li>
<li>Informal: Neither of the students knows/know the answer.</li>
<li>Formal: Neither of the students knows the answer.</li></ul>

<p>When used as a determiner, neither precedes a singular noun and takes a singular verb like is or has.</p>

<ul>EXAMPLES
<li>Neither car is right for me.</li>
<li>Neither applicant has the right skills for the job.</li>
<li>Neither student knows the answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like neither, either is grammatically singular and agrees with singular verbs like is and has. However:</p>
<ul>EXAMPLE
<li>Informal: Either of these is/are fine.</li>
<li>Formal: Either of these is fine.</li>
</ul>

<ul>EXAMPLES
<li>Neither of these candidates is suitable for the job.</li>
<li>Neither of the lawnmowers is available.</li>
</ul>
